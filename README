Bells and whistles task implementation for http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code/Run_examples

Adjust the %resources hash to customize handling of the various tasks. By default is set up to be
an fairly hands-off smoke tester. Will attempt to download all of the Perl 6 code for tasks that
claim to have a Perl 6 eample, extracts blocks of code within <lang perl6> ... </lang> markup, then
runs each block. The resources hash is configured to skip tasks with no code and fragment code blocks:
blocks that will not compile or run because of missing features (mostly fragments of example code).
It will skip blocks that require heavey user interaction (Probably will be adjustable with a
paramter in the future), and limits very long or infinite running code to 15 CPU seconds or less.

Run at a command line: perl6 RC-run.p6
to try every implemented task.

Feed it a task name to try only that task: perl6 RC-run.p6 Lucky_and_even_lucky_numbers
(Replace spaces with underscores.)
